Learning and documenting markdown

_Use underscore_ (_) _from head to tail to show italics_

**Use double asterisks** (**) **to make characters bold**

**Bold** and _italic_ can be used in the same line

**Bold** and _italic_ can also be used together, for example:\
**_double asterisk followed by underscore_**\
_**underscore followed by double asterisk**_

Use hash mark(#) to dictate size of header, more hash = smaller size\
# Largest
## Getting smaller
### Include space between the hash marks and word
#### Not small enough
##### Is it small enough yet?
###### 6 (#) is the smallest u can get
